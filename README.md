# Double Word algorithm
This program was made with turing machine language. It accepts only words in the alphabet [a,b]* and transforms the input word into it's double (e.g.: palavra-> "ab", output-> "abab").
The regular expression that represents this rule is: ww | w âˆˆ [a,b]*.

# How to run 
You can run the code in the Turing Machine Simulator founded in the internet through the link: http://morphett.info/turing/turing.html
